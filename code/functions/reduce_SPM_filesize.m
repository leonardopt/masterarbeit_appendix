function reduced_SPM = reduce_SPM_filesize(SPM, savefile)
% reduce_SPM_filesize(SPM, savefile)
%
% this strips of all of the fields that are HUGE and not necessary to pass
% along data (e.g. the filenames + fullpath of the input files etc)
%
% USAGE
% reduce_SPM_filesize()
%   loads the SPM.mat of the current folder and saves the stripped version
%   to SPM_reduced.mat (recommended)
%
% reduced_SPM = reduce_SPM_filesize()
%   also returns the reduced SPM struct
% 
% reduce_SPM_filesize(SPM)
%   saves the reduced version of the provided SPM struct (no file details
%   of the original file saved then)
% 
% reduced_SPM = reduce_SPM_filesize(SPM, 0)
%   does not save the file, only returns the stripped version.
% 
% reduce_SPM_filesize(SPM, filename)
%   saves the reduced SPM.mat to filename
%
% DETAILED DESCRIPTION
% The following description comes from a SPM file that was 89MB before file
% reduction
% 
% Name      Size                Bytes  Class     Attributes
% 
%   SPM       1x1             127389815  struct   
%
% The only fields that we really need at the moment are the regressor names
% (to create a design from SPM). These are in SPM.xX.name
%
% This is tiny:
%
%   Name      Size            Bytes  Class    Attributes
%
%   name      1x21             1848  cell  
%
% So we simply save only this field and save a lots of space.

% Now allows passing the file location as the first SPM argument instead of
%  having to cd into the actual folder. Added to the AFX pipeline - Ingmar
